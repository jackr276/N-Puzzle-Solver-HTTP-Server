Here's the idea:

All of these N-Puzzle Solvers online do everything in the front-end via some JS code that solves it. That's why you(the client machine) see your RAM and CPU usage spike when you try to solve one of these things.
But this is very bad, because JS is very slow, and the state space solver is memory/CPU hungry. It can crash the browser for complex problems.

What if we could instead do this:
	1.) Have a nice GUI online web interface that just shows us the gameboard
	2.) Have a multithreaded C server side application that does all of the actual computation for the N-Puzzle game for us. We can then have an efficient, custom network protocol to transfer the N-Puzzle to the webpage.
	3.) (Maybe) have user input on the client side
